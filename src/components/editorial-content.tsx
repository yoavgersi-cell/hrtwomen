        What Are Menopause and Perimenopause?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Menopause is the point when menstrual periods stop for good, confirmed after 12 months in a
        row without a period. It happens as the ovaries make less estrogen and progesterone. Most women
        go through menopause between about 45 and 55, and the average age in the U.S. is around 51.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8">
        Perimenopause is the transition leading up to it, and it can last several years. Hormone levels
        fluctuate, periods often become irregular, and symptoms can start well before the final period.
        Menopause is a natural life stage, not an illness - but symptoms can be disruptive, and you do
        not have to simply put up with them. Understanding what is happening is the first step toward
        the right support.

      <p className="mb-4">
        Every woman&apos;s experience is different. Some notice very little change; others find
        symptoms affect sleep, work and relationships. Symptoms usually fall into a few groups, and
        they often overlap.

        <strong>Worth knowing:</strong> Some of these symptoms overlap with other conditions, such as
        thyroid problems, anemia or depression. And any bleeding after menopause should always be

        Types of Menopause Treatment, Compared
      </h2>

        Menopause symptoms can be managed with hormone therapy, non-hormonal medication, lifestyle
        changes, or a combination. Here is how the main options compare - these are options to discuss

        Estrogen can be taken through the skin (patches, gels, sprays) or by mouth. Both can relieve
        symptoms effectively, but the route changes how estrogen is processed - and that matters for
        some risks. Neither is &quot;better&quot; universally; the right fit depends on your health
        history and a clinician&apos;s assessment.

        How Online (Telehealth) Menopause Care Works
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Telehealth has made it easier to reach clinicians who focus on menopause - often faster than
        waiting for a specialist appointment. The process at a legitimate provider follows the same
        clinical backbone:
      </p>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc space-y-1 pl-6">
        <li><strong>Online intake</strong> - you complete a confidential questionnaire about symptoms, periods, personal and family history, and current medications.</li>
        <li><strong>Licensed clinician review</strong> - a real prescriber evaluates your risks and whether treatment is appropriate, often by video or message.</li>
        <li><strong>Prescription (if suitable)</strong> - if hormone or non-hormonal therapy is right for you, it is prescribed; you are never guaranteed a prescription.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow-up & monitoring</strong> - dose adjustments, side-effect check-ins, and reminders about routine screening such as mammograms.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>What a legitimate provider looks like:</strong> clinicians trained in menopause care, a real risk assessment, clear pricing before checkout, ongoing follow-up, and licensed U.S. pharmacies.</p>
      <p className="mb-8"><strong>Red flags to avoid:</strong> &quot;no prescription needed&quot; hormones, claims that any product is completely risk-free or &quot;reverses aging&quot;, no clinician involvement, no screening questions about clots or cancer history, and hidden fees. See our

        <li><strong>Treatment choice</strong> - patches, gels, pills, vaginal estrogen, progesterone and non-hormonal options where appropriate</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing support</strong> - follow-up visits, dose adjustments and a human to reach with questions</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance & lab options</strong> - some providers accept insurance for visits or can order labs when clinically useful</li>

        What Does Online HRT Cost?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Cost is one of the biggest differences between providers. Rather than quote figures that
        change constantly, it helps to understand what actually drives the total:
      </p>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc space-y-1 pl-6">
        <li><strong>Visit and membership fees</strong> - some providers charge per consultation, others use a monthly membership that bundles follow-up care.</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance</strong> - some menopause clinics, such as Midi Health, work with insurance for visits; others are cash-pay only. Coverage depends on your plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Medication type</strong> - FDA-approved generic estradiol and progesterone can be billed through a regular pharmacy, while custom-compounded products are usually cash-pay.</li>
        <li><strong>Labs and add-ons</strong> - lab tests, supplements or extra services can add to the monthly total.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-8">
        To compare fairly, look at the <strong>total monthly cost for the care and medication you would
        actually use</strong> - including visits, membership, pharmacy and shipping - not just the

        Is HRT Safe? Understanding the Risks
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        It&apos;s the most-asked HRT question - and the honest answer is &quot;it depends on you.&quot;
        Hormone therapy has <strong>real benefits and real risks</strong>. For many healthy women who
        start within about 10 years of menopause or before age 60, major medical societies consider the
        benefits for bothersome symptoms to generally outweigh the risks.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8">
        Risks depend on the type of hormone, the dose, the route, how long you use it, your age and
        your personal and family history. They can include <strong>blood clots, stroke</strong> and, with
        combined estrogen plus progestogen, a small increase in <strong>breast cancer</strong> risk with
        longer use. HRT is not recommended for everyone - for example, women with a history of
        certain cancers, blood clots, stroke or liver disease may need other options. No treatment is
        risk-free and none should promise to stop aging. We break this down in

        When to See a Doctor - and Staying Safe
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Menopause is natural, but it is also a good moment to check in on your overall health - heart,
        bones, breasts and mood - not just symptoms. Speak with a clinician if symptoms affect your
        daily life, or if you have any of the warning signs below.
      </p>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc space-y-1 pl-6">
        <li><strong>Any bleeding after menopause</strong> (12+ months without a period) should be checked promptly.</li>
        <li><strong>Disclose your full medication list and health history</strong> - including clots, migraine, cancer and heart disease - so a prescriber can screen for contraindications.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep up with routine screening</strong> such as mammograms and cervical screening while on treatment.</li>
        <li><strong>Seek urgent care for signs of a clot or stroke</strong> - leg pain or swelling, chest pain, sudden shortness of breath, sudden weakness, vision or speech changes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-8">
        In short: use a legitimate provider with real clinical oversight, review your treatment at
        least yearly, and treat menopause care as part of your overall health.

        Frequently Asked Questions
      </h2>

      <h3 className="mb-2 text-[18px] font-bold text-[#191919]">What is the most effective treatment for hot flashes?</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Systemic estrogen therapy is considered the most effective treatment for hot flashes and night
        sweats, but it is not suitable for everyone. Non-hormonal prescriptions can also help. The best
        choice depends on your health, symptoms and preferences - and it is one a licensed clinician
        should make with you.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mb-2 text-[18px] font-bold text-[#191919]">Can I start HRT during perimenopause?</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Often, yes. Many women start treatment while still having periods, when symptoms first appear.
        A clinician can advise on options that suit an irregular cycle. See 
        <Link href="/articles/perimenopause-symptoms" className="font-semibold text-[#A8285E] hover:underline">

      <h3 className="mb-2 text-[18px] font-bold text-[#191919]">Do I need a prescription for HRT?</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Yes. Estrogen and progesterone therapies are prescription-only for safety reasons. Legitimate
        telehealth providers make this straightforward - a licensed clinician reviews your history
        before prescribing. Any site offering hormones with &quot;no prescription needed&quot; is a red
        flag.
